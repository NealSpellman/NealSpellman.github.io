<h3>Welcome!</h3>

Hey, you've just ended up on Neal Spellman's portfolio! I graduated from Becker College in 2018 with a B.A. in Interactive Media Design. From there, I concentrated in Game Development and Programming.

During college, I worked on a couple professional titles with Accipiter Studio; Becker Quest, JayWalker and The Machine. While Becker Quest never got shipped, the other two are available for download on the Microsoft Store! These projects can be found on the Professional Projects page.

I also started a project with Gie Vanommeslaeghe way back in 2013 known as Darkflame Universe. This can also be found on the Professional Projects page and isn't specifically a game; it's a server emulator for LEGO Universe. Over this past year, it got [covered by MassivelyOP](http://massivelyop.com/2017/01/03/gamers-resurrect-lego-universe-as-darkflame-universe-with-january-alpha/) and hit over 5,000 registered users. I stepped down from my management position on the project but I still contribute whenever I can find the time.

I currently work at PTC as an Associate AR Developer, specifically on the Waypoint team. I'm also working on games during my spare time, which I can hopefully feature here when they're further along!
