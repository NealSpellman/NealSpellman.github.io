<h3>Welcome!</h3>

Hey, you've just ended up on Neal Spellman's portfolio! I'll be graduating from Becker College in May of 2018 with a B.A. in Interactive Media Design. From that, I concentrated in Game Development and Programming. That's essentially the Programming track for the Game major here.

Outside of the classroom, I've worked on a couple professional titles with Accipiter Studio; Becker Quest, JayWalker and The Machine. While Becker Quest never got shipped, the other two are available for download on the Microsoft Store! These projects can be found on the Professional Projects page here.

I also started a project with Gie Vanommeslaeghe way back in 2013 known as Darkflame Universe. This can also be found on the Professional Projects page and isn't specifically a game; it's a server emulator for LEGO Universe. Over this past year, it got [covered by MassivelyOP](http://massivelyop.com/2017/01/03/gamers-resurrect-lego-universe-as-darkflame-universe-with-january-alpha/) and hit over 6,000 registered users. I stepped down from my management position on the project but I still contribute whenever I can find the time.
