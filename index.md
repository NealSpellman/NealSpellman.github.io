Hey, I'm Neal Spellman! I graduated from Becker College in 2018 with a B.A. in Interactive Media Design. From there, I concentrated in Game Development and Programming.

During college, I worked on a couple professional titles with Accipiter Studio; Becker Quest, JayWalker and The Machine. While Becker Quest never got shipped, the other two are available for download on the Microsoft Store! These projects can be found on the Professional Projects page.

I also started a project with Gie Vanommeslaeghe way back in 2013 known as Darkflame Universe. This can also be found on the Professional Projects page and isn't specifically a game; it's a server emulator for LEGO Universe, a defunct MMO. It's been [covered by MassivelyOP](http://massivelyop.com/2017/01/03/gamers-resurrect-lego-universe-as-darkflame-universe-with-january-alpha/) and has over 15,000 registered users, with a nice 10k following on Twitter. I manage the social media, lead the team, create maps and mods for the game.

As for what I'm currently doing full-time, I'm an Augmented Reality Engineer at PTC! I started at PTC as an Associate AR Engineer just about a week after graduating college and got promoted recently. I've worked on the following apps while there:
<ul>
 <li>Vuforia Capture, HoloLens</li>
 <li>Vuforia Capture, RealWear</li>
 <li>Vuforia View, HoloLens</li>
 <li>Vuforia Chalk, RealWear</li>
 <li>Vuforia Chalk, Android</li>
 <li>Unannounced app, HoloLens</li>
</ul>

I'm looking for opportunities that let me utilize some of my technical background, but primarily letting me focus on design.
