Hello, I'm Neal Spellman and this is my portfolio site! 

Back in 2015, I graduated highschool and went on to Becker College to study Game Development and Programming. While attending college classes, I worked at Accipiter Studios and created 3 different games. Two of those went on to be released on the Microsoft Store, [JayWalker](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/jaywalker/9p76lxr8hhb0) and [The Machine](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/the-machine-demo/9nhxpw0b2hwl)! After graduating with a BA in 2018, I started working at PTC and have been there since.

I also spent almost a decade reviving LEGO Universe with [Gie Vanommeslaeghe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gie-vanommeslaeghe-a4a7a9139), starting back in 2013 and ending in 2021 with open sourcing our completed server source code.. Check out [Darkflame Universe's Twitter](https://twitter.com/darkflameuniv) for more information on our following!

Outside of work, I can often be found making mods for games, drafting design documents for things I'd change/add to others, or just catching up on the latest news around AR/VR/gaming. I'm also working on my own game, codenamed Organized Slime! No real title yet, but I've gotten the tech base down and am working on grey boxing all important mechanics.

Throughout the years of working at both Accipiter Studios and PTC, I've gotten to work on dozens of apps as both a designer and engineer. The list includes but is not limited to;

Shipped Projects:
<ul>
 <li>Jaywalker (HoloLens - C# - Unity)</li>
 <li>The Machine (HoloLens - C# - Unity)</li>
 <li>Vuforia Capture (HoloLens - C# - Unity)</li>
 <li>Vuforia Capture (RealWear - Java)</li>
 <li>Vuforia View (HoloLens)</li>
 <li>Vuforia Chalk (RealWear - Java)</li>
 <li>Vuforia Chalk (Android - Java)</li>
 <li>Vuforia Vantage (Android/RealWear - Java)</li>
 <li>Vuforia Vantage (HoloLens/MagicLeap - C#)</li>
 <li>New Vuforia Capture (HoloLens/MagicLeap - C#)</li>
 <li>Darkflame Universe (Server emulator)</li>
 <li>... and more!</li>
</ul>

I'm very proud of the work I've been able to accomplish at both of these positions across all those apps, but ideally am looking for a role within the game industry to blend both my technical skills and design experience. I'm happy to hear about strictly technical roles relating to AR/VR, Unity, or Android, too!
