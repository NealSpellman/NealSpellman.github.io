* Self-taught myself Lua by researching dozens of client scripts and creating new ones.
* Created 2 scripts to visualize database values for the player's customization options.
* Modified multiple game worlds using Lua, which will be reflected in future Darkflame Universe client updates.
* Made a master document of Lua functions and their arguments by dumping from the executable.
