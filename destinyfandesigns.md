Destiny and looter shooters in general are some of my favorite games of all time. There's something about the rush of getting awesome loot and using it with other players to defeat giant monsters that just gets me, you know?

There's also a lot with the current looter shooter genre that I don't enjoy and it's something I wish I could work on professionally. I took the time to draft two documents about pain points I've seen talked about and experienced personally, which are both things I'd love to flesh out deeper and implement if server emulation gets further.

[This design document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U4_rl-em8Dgsw6hVt_XP8O0lmDNyhYsX/view?usp=sharing) was used as an exercise to practice quest design for an MMO-lite, offering player progression for a "season".
* Details estimated time for hardcore and casual/average players to complete each step and individual goal.
* Incentivizes gameplay across the season without power/item level attached to it, focusing more on letting players create builds they like and earn cosmetics.

* Incentivizes playing a bunch of matches to try and win, but still guarantees you won't walk away with nothing at our minimum effort level.
* Gives the player something they can do with friends that can easily be updated in new seasons, reusing any past/present boss monsters.
