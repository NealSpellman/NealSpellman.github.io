<p align="center"><h2>Expert Capture</h2></p>

While at PTC, I mainly have worked on the Expert Capture solutions for headsets and mobile. This includes headsets like HoloLens, RealWear, Magic Leap and Vuzix.
Throughout the years, there have been many times I've had a chance to work on design tasks and tackle implementation of new features.

I cannot include images of unreleased, unused or in-progress work, but I can talk through some of the design related work I did.

* Designed and implemented a new notification system for Vuforia Capture on RealWear, as at the time we had very little confirmation around user actions.
* Implemented all audio across the Vuforia Capture app on HoloLens, including balancing all sounds and working with the audio team to tweak problematic clips.
    * This also included pitching and prototyping different sounds or mixes, going through a review from the design lead and project owner.
* Created A/B tests for Vuforia Capture when we were still in a prototyping phase and participated in design reviews with customers.
* Led the charge on new feature implementation and designing how they worked for new technology, such as HoloLens 2's hand & eye tracking.
* Acted as a technical designer for the UX team, providing them with a toolkit to build their own prototypes and helping out whenever new functionality was needed.

<p align="center"><h2>Darkflame Universe</h2></p>

Back in 2013, I started a project to revive [LEGO Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Universe), a defunct MMORPG made by NetDevil.
I spent my years working on project management for this, leading a team of content designers and developers while also learning lua to do scripting. We eventually even got the in-game level editor to work and I created limited time content for holidays/special events.
In 2021, [we shipped Darkflame Universe and it's publicly available to try!](https://github.com/DarkflameUniverse/DarkflameServer)

* Created a winter content zone named "Snowman's Land" as a proof-of-concept for player developed worlds being added into the client.
    * Video attached below; this content was shipped in our game client and players were able to visit it through our winter event.
    * This was created using the in-game level editor solely with already in-game assets, needing no programmer or art team members.
* Taught myself lua scripting and dumped all of the game's custom lua functions for future content use.
* Led the design team and participated in design sessions for other new content, such as in-game items and balancing current content.
* Created a new endgame hub called "Horizon Crux", where the player would receive their first look at the big bad's lair off in the skybox.
    * This area was inspired by [Ultima Thule in Final Fantasy XIV](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/6/66/FFXIV_Ultima_Thule_loading.png/revision/latest?cb=20211216031614).
    * Pictures of this prototype zone can be found below, with a design process and design document being included here at a later date.

<p align="center"><h2>JayWalker</h2></p>

While at Accipiter Studios, which was a professor-run in-house studio for Becker College, everyone got a chance to pitch their own game ideas.
Our professor stressed the fact that these games needed to be *simple*; one main gameplay mechanic that the game was built on.

When looking for something simple, I thought back to the original Frogger; all you had to do was get across. Of course that's oversimplifying the journey of getting across and whatever obstacles you'd encounter in the level, but it was enough to make me think of a new idea.

JayWalker was the game I came up with. [This pitch document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sAOkYYNzukxzW6OqXaUtCDt9fDryxbae/view?usp=sharing) and a *very* simple prototype won over the studio, cementing JayWalker as the game we'd make.

Here's what JayWalker looked like initially in my prototype and early builds;

Throughout the single semester of development, we hosted playtests on campus and balanced the game around feedback received. We also showcased JayWalker at PAX East in 2017!

And of course, here's the finished version of our main map;

<p align="center"><h3>Crossing Mode</h3></p>

During both our playtests and at PAX East, we had people ask us if cars came from both directions and if that was something we could add. I was curious about the idea so I took the HoloLens back to my dorm and set to work on a prototype for a new mode to pitch!

After developing a barebones concept level that I called "Crossing", I presented it to the studio and let them try it. It took some technical discussions with the other programmers about the changes needed, but the team loved it.

This, unfortunately, was close to our deadlines for putting the game up on the app store; I ended up working extra hard on doing the remaining engineering and design work to cut down on work the rest of the team would have to do.

It was shipped with our initial app build on the [Microsoft Store, which can be downloaded for free](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/jaywalker/9p76lxr8hhb0)!

<p align="center"><h2>Destiny Fan Designs</h2></p>
Destiny and looter shooters in general are some of my favorite games of all time. There's something about the rush of getting awesome loot and using it with other players to defeat giant monsters that just gets me, you know?

There's also a lot with the current looter shooter genre that I don't enjoy and it's something I wish I could work on professionally. I took the time to draft two documents about pain points I've seen talked about and experienced personally, which are both things I'd love to flesh out deeper and implement if server emulation gets further.

<p align="center"><h3>Concept Pinnacle Quest in Destiny 2</h3></p>
[This design document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U4_rl-em8Dgsw6hVt_XP8O0lmDNyhYsX/view?usp=sharing) was used as an exercise to practice quest design for an MMO-lite, offering player progression for a "season".
* Details estimated time for hardcore and casual/average players to complete each step and individual goal.
* Incentivizes gameplay across the season without power/item level attached to it, focusing more on letting players create builds they like and earn cosmetics.

* Incentivizes playing a bunch of matches to try and win, but still guarantees you won't walk away with nothing at our minimum effort level.
* Gives the player something they can do with friends that can easily be updated in new seasons, reusing any past/present boss monsters.
