<p align="center"><h1>Vuforia Chalk (Java)</h1></p>

[Vuforia Chalk](https://chalk.vuforia.com/) is the leading remote assistance and expert guidance app, produced by PTC. While I can't share any videos of the app on RealWear, I can talk a little about what I worked on:

<ul>
 <li>Built RealWear-specific UI on top of the original Android app.</li>
 <li>Collaborated closely with the UX team when implementing audio and image assets.</li>
 <li>Reworked how notifications were displayed.</li>
</ul>


<p align="center"><h1>Vuforia Capture (C#, Java)</h1></p>

[Vuforia Capture](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/vuforia-capture/9nnvljc9f5zl#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) is an enterprise solution for the HoloLens and RealWear. It's part of the Vuforia Expert Capture suite with my work being solely on the Capture / "record" side of things. I worked on this from the very start of it being at PTC, being in close contact with the UX team and helping on the design side whenever possible in addition to my normal engineering duties.

* Shipped Vuforia Capture for the HoloLens and RealWear, along with working a few unannounced apps on their way to being shipped.
* Brainstormed with UX on creative input methods and design choices for augmented reality platforms such as the HoloLens 2.
* Created tools for UX to use for rapid prototyping in Unity and on the HoloLens.
* Responsible for backend data structure compatibility and design.
* Worked on many more features across both platforms, such as notifications, UI, user interaction and more.
