Hello, I'm Neal Spellman and this is my portfolio site! 

Back in 2015, I graduated highschool and went on to Becker College to study Game Development and Programming. While attending college classes, I worked at Accipiter Studios and created 3 different games. Two of those went on to be released on the Microsoft Store, [JayWalker](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/jaywalker/9p76lxr8hhb0) and [The Machine](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/the-machine-demo/9nhxpw0b2hwl)! After graduating with a BA in 2018, I started working at PTC and have been there since.

I also spent almost a decade reviving LEGO Universe with [Gie Vanommeslaeghe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gie-vanommeslaeghe-a4a7a9139), starting back in 2013 and ending in 2021 with open sourcing our completed server source code.. Check out [Darkflame Universe's Twitter](https://twitter.com/darkflameuniv) for more information on our project!

Outside of work, I can often be found making mods for games, drafting design documents for things I'd change/add to others, or just catching up on the latest news around AR/VR/gaming. I'm also working on my own game, codenamed Organized Slime! No real title yet, but I've gotten the tech base down and am working on grey boxing all important mechanics.
