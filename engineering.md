<p align="center"><h1>Organized Slime (C#)</h1></p>
I can provide videos/demo builds upon request, but this one is still very early on.
* Designed a modular grid system and a way to store "dirty" tiles dynamically, able to be restored easily during runtime and filtered to specific mechanic's dirty tiles.
* Led playtesting sessions with friends to improve the basic gameplay feel before building too many mechanics.
* Made sure mechanics can be easily updated via difficulty options, providing full control to things like time they take, how many squares are effected, etc.
* Brainstormed a list of mechanics for an MVP and am working through my list to implement them with simple grey boxed shapes.

<p align="center"><h1>Vuforia Chalk (Java)</h1></p>

[Vuforia Chalk](https://chalk.vuforia.com/) is the leading remote assistance and expert guidance app, produced by PTC. While I can't share any videos of the app on RealWear, I can talk a little about what I worked on:

<ul>
 <li>Built RealWear-specific UI on top of the original Android app.</li>
 <li>Collaborated closely with the UX team when implementing audio and image assets.</li>
 <li>Reworked how notifications were displayed.</li>
</ul>


<p align="center"><h1>Vuforia Capture and Vantage (C#, Java)</h1></p>

[Vuforia Capture](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/vuforia-capture/9nnvljc9f5zl#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) is an enterprise solution for the HoloLens 1 & 2, Magic Leap and RealWear. It's part of the Vuforia Expert Capture suite, with my work being on both the Capture and Vantage sides. I worked on this from the very start of it being at PTC, being in close contact with the UX team and helping on the design side whenever possible in addition to my normal engineering duties.

* Shipped Vuforia Capture and Vantage for the HoloLens 1 & 2, Magic Leap and RealWear.
* Led the charge on a reworked Vuforia Capture app, which replaced the original 2019 version and features numerous improvements.
* Brainstormed with UX on creative input methods and design choices for augmented reality platforms such as the HoloLens 2.
* Created tools for UX to use for rapid prototyping in Unity and on the HoloLens.
* Owned the repositories and did release manager duties such as cutting releases, updating CI variables and managing localization updates along with release hotfixes.
* Worked on many more features across both platforms, such as notifications, UI, user interaction and more.
