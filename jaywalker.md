<p align="center"><h2>Overview</h2></p>

While at Accipiter Studios, which was a professor-run in-house studio for Becker College, everyone got a chance to pitch their own game ideas.
Our professor stressed the fact that these games needed to be *simple*; one main gameplay mechanic that the game was built on.

When looking for something simple, I thought back to the original Frogger; all you had to do was get across. Of course that's oversimplifying the journey of getting across and whatever obstacles you'd encounter in the level, but it was enough to make me think of a new idea.

JayWalker was the game I came up with. [This pitch document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sAOkYYNzukxzW6OqXaUtCDt9fDryxbae/view?usp=sharing) was what I took to our next studio meeting and presented, which was voted favorite of the entire studio.

Throughout the single semester of development, we hosted playtests on campus and balanced the game around feedback received. We also showcased JayWalker at PAX East in 2017!

During both our playtests and at PAX East, we had people ask us if cars came from both directions and if that was something we could add. I was curious about the idea so I took the HoloLens back to my dorm and set to work on a prototype for a new mode to pitch!

After developing a barebones concept level that I called "Crossing", I presented it to the studio and let them try it. It took some technical discussions with the other programmers about the changes needed, but the team loved it.

This, unfortunately, was close to our deadlines for putting the game up on the app store; I ended up working extra hard on doing the remaining engineering and design work to cut down on work the rest of the team would have to do.

It was shipped with our initial app build on the [Microsoft Store, which can be downloaded for free](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/jaywalker/9p76lxr8hhb0)!
