Hi! Welcome to my website! I'm Neal Spellman, Lead Game Programmer at Accipiter Studio.
I also co-founded Darkflame Universe back in 2013, which has now grown to over 4,000 users.

I'm graduating from Becker College in May of 2018 with a BA in Interactive Media Design.
More specifically, I chose a concentration in Game Development and Programming for my degree.
