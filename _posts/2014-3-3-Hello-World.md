Hey, thanks for stopping by!
As you can tell, I'm Neal Spellman. I've worked as Game Programmer and Lead Game Programmer for Accipiter Studio at Becker College.
On the side, I also cofounded and work on Darkflame Universe. It's a server emulator for the game LEGO Universe!
For that project, I manage all of the staff and development team. I also run the Twitter account (@darkflameuniv) for it.

This is a WIP and will be updated
