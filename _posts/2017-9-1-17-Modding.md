The playlist linked will be updated as I continue to create mods for LEGO Universe.

* Self-taught myself Lua by researching dozens of client scripts and creating new ones.

* Created 2 scripts to visualize database values for the player's customization options.

* Modified multiple game worlds using Lua, which will be reflected in future Darkflame Universe client updates.

* Made a master document of Lua functions and their arguments by dumping from the executable.

Code can be requested by interested employers by reaching out on any of the footer links.
