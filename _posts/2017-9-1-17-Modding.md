The playlist linked will be updated as I continue to create mods for LEGO Universe.

As it stands, I've learned how to use the pre-existing base of functions that the original developers created.

I learned how to change the skybox, edit the lighting values and then even apply effects to the world. Camera modding was also explored.

I wrote my own scripts for visualizing many values in the database, such cycling through all the player customization choices while in-game.

I've self-taught myself Lua during this project and it's been great to learn it with this kind of tool.
